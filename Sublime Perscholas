<h2>Hi my name is Whitney Vigio</h2>
<h3>I'm excited to start this class</h3>
<p>I'm originally from Pennsylvania, but I moved to New york when I was 19 years old. I've always loved science, and learning about computers. I didn't pursue it before because I was horrible in math, and I thought it would be too difficult for me, I never thought of my self as, not even a bit close to having einstien intelligence. But I now know it takes dedication to learn what I love, and I can do it. I'm so excited and grateful to be given this opportunity to pursue software engineering.</p>
